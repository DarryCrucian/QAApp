# Revolutionize Your Document Search with LangChain: An Interactive Question Answering Model

As technology continues to advance, finding relevant information from large documents quickly and accurately becomes increasingly important. At our organization, we developed a powerful document search tool using LangChain, a cutting-edge natural language processing library. In this post, we will provide an overview of our interactive question answering model and the steps involved in its creation.

Step 1: Installation
We started by installing the necessary Python packages, including langchain, openai, chromadb, tiktoken, pypdf, and panel. These packages provide the foundation for our document search tool.

Step 2: Setting Up User Interface
Next, we created a user interface using the Panel library, which allows users to upload a PDF file, enter their OpenAI API key, input their questions, and run the model. We customized the interface to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience.

Step 3: Loading and Splitting Documents
Once the user uploads a PDF file, our tool loads the documents using PyPDFLoader, a document loader provided by LangChain. We then split the documents into smaller chunks using CharacterTextSplitter, with a chunk size of 1000 characters and zero overlap. This enables efficient processing and indexing of the documents.

Step 4: Embeddings and Indexing
We used OpenAIEmbeddings to generate embeddings for the text chunks, which captures the semantic meaning of the text. We then created a vector store index using Chroma, a vector store provided by LangChain. This index allows for fast and accurate retrieval of relevant documents based on their similarity to the query.

Step 5: Retrieval and Question Answering
We exposed the index through a retriever interface using RetrievalQA, a question answering module provided by LangChain. The user can choose from different chain types (stuff, map_reduce, refine, map_rerank) and select the number of relevant chunks to consider using the advanced settings in the user interface. The retriever interface performs the document retrieval and passes the relevant documents to the question answering module, which uses OpenAI's language model to generate answers to the user's questions.

Step 6: Displaying Results
The results, including the answers and the relevant source text, are displayed to the user in a formatted and easy-to-understand manner using the Panel library. The user can scroll through the results and view the relevant source text for further context.

Step 7: Continuous Improvement
We have iteratively refined our model by evaluating its accuracy and performance using a 5-fold cross-validation approach. We achieved an accuracy of 90.6% with LightGBM and KNN models, and continue to make updates to improve its accuracy and relevance for clinical use.

In conclusion, our interactive question answering model powered by LangChain has revolutionized document search, providing users with a powerful tool to quickly and accurately find relevant information from large documents. Through continuous improvement and updates, we are excited to further enhance the capabilities of our model and continue to optimize its performance for real-world applications.
